## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Most intersting topic that we covered in my domain this quarter was the climate model emulators and how the emulators are able to take extremely large amounts of data which include both time data and location data.
This emulator gave us the basis for our quarter 1 project which was basically replicating the research paper our mentor has written. 
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation taht we would possibly pursue for our quarter 2 project is why some models like CNN or random forest regressor underperform compared to the actual results produced
by climate models that we have currently. We were possibly thinking that this was due to less training data and want to see if there is a way to augment our current training data to possibly produce more training data.
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I dont know if I would make much changes as our quarter 1 project has gone pretty smoothly as it was mainly a replication of a paper but I think one change I could make is
asking quetsions sooner rather than later when I am stuck. There were times this quarter were I was doing a task like trying to reproduce a random forest model but my file paths were not
working for some reason. I think asking for help or asking questions sooner rarther than later would be helpful. 
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I think one technique that could be interesting for our quarter 2 project is sort of an augmentation of our training data. Our mentor told us about this augmentation that was done to 
non labeled data at google and how they basically augmented it in some way to make two points but grouped together, the augmented point and the orignal point are more similar to each other than 
the other picked point and the other picked point's augmentation. If we could do something with this to explore getting more training data, that could be interesting.
